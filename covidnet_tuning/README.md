# COVID-Net Open Source Tuning Strategy

The core COVID-Net has free parameters which, when chosen effectively can improve the performance of the COVID-Net in specific, desired ways. 

In this module we provide such a strategy, where these key choices are parametrized and then optimized using Bayesian optimization.  This is done using the SigOpt API, which is free to use for academic/scholarly purposes.
